# hello-world
This is my first program in GitHub. As usual, the program just prints out the beloved phrase: hello world.

Just trying to get acquianted with GitHub. It feels like something useful and intuitive. I hope I'll be able to use this when I learn Java and write my 
first open-source calendar and todo application.
